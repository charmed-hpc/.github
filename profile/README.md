# Welcome to Charmed HPC!

__Automate the deployment and management of your supercomputing clusters üöÄ__

</div>

## üî¨ What we do 

We are the Ubuntu High-Performance Computing Community! Together, we work on Charmed HPC, an approachable high-performance computing platform that manages the set up and 
maintenance of HPC clusters for you. Charmed HPC handles common cluster operations by automating the deployment, 
integration, and life-cycle management of essential HPC software. It also automatically configures GPUs, high bandwidth networking, and shared storage.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Can I contribute to Charmed HPC even if I do not feel like I am an HPC expert or I have no idea what the Ubuntu HPC community does?

Absolutely! Anyone can contribute to Charmed HPC! All we ask is that you first review the [contributing section](#contributing) of this README before starting work on your first contribution.

### Is there a time-commitment?

No, there is no specific time commitment! You can just hang out and talk about Ubuntu and HPC if that is what you are interested in. What we do ask though is that you refrain from taking on commitments if you know that you do not have enough time or bandwidth to deliver your contributions.

### Can I contact this team for support with Charmed HPC?

Support is provided on a best-effort basis; we are all busy people! The General room in the [#hpc:ubuntu.com](https://matrix.to/#/#hpc:ubuntu.com) Matrix is the best place to go for live discussion. If your question is rather complicated, you would like to be able to reference the solution later, or you prefer asynchronous communication, we recommend posting your question to GitHub Discussions instead.

### Where should I go if I want to report an issue/bug?

Send a message to the General room on the [#hpc:ubuntu.com](https://matrix.to/#/#hpc:ubuntu.com) Matrix. The team can help you triage the issue and point you to the correct project to raise a bug report against. Please make sure to also review the [Bug Reports](https://github.com/charmed-hpc/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports) section of the CONTRIBUTING.md guide. 

### What if I am doing something interesting in HPC and want to share it with the Ubuntu HPC community?

We are always excited to discuss exciting new open-source projects in the HPC ecosystem, but we are not interested in being advertised to. If you have a free and open-source project that is open for community contribution that you would like to share with the Ubuntu HPC community, you are more than welcome to promote it. However, we ask that you refrain from promoting commercial and/or proprietary products and services.

### Does this project follow a code of conduct?

Yes, we follow and enforce the [Ubuntu Code of Conduct, version 2.0](https://ubuntu.com/community/ethos/code-of-conduct). Please refer to the Ubuntu Community [Ethos](https://ubuntu.com/community/ethos) if you wish to learn more about our Code of Conduct, Diversity Policy, and Mission.
